# A* Algorithm Implementation
An implementation of https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html in TypeScript.

# Install

Install the needed packages with

```sh
npm install
```
(I want to try to implement my own priority queue some time, so maybe no need to use npm!)

# Run the program
```sh
npm run start
```

# Editing the program
The grid can be any size. Currently, 0's represent empty spaces, 1's represent walls / obstacles.<br>
When the algorithm is complete, S is the start, E is the end, and the blue line is the path that was found.<br><br>

You an adjust the ending and starting points by changing the x & y positions of their defintions.
